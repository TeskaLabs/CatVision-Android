		<p><strong>Pairing</strong></p>
		<p style="text-align: justify;">
			For screen share of this application and your device, you need to first Pair CatVision.io mobile app with Web-App located on app.catvision.io. You can do this by scanning QR Code placed in Web-App or via Browser on your mobile, just tap on PAIR ME, then via Browser button, sign up or log in and then tap on the proper button. Refresh page and your app is paired with Web-App and you can start screen-sharing by tapping on SHARE ME button.

		<p><strong>Screen Share</strong></p>
		<p style="text-align: justify;">
			Screen-sharing is beneficial technology; you can see from your browser what is displayed on the screen of your mobile device, and more! You can even control UI elements of the application itself. Understandably, you can't control device itself. It would need to be approved by the device manufacturer, for example, Samsung or Huawei. But you can see everything that's going on!

	<div>
		<p><strong>Unpair</strong></p>
		<p style="text-align: justify;">
			Function unpair serves its logical purpose; it will delete your pairing with Web-App, for example, if you wish to pair application with new Product inside Web-App.

		<p><strong>What is "Product"?</strong></p>
		<p style="text-align: justify;">
			The product is how we call environment from where you can access mobile devices with your application equipped with CatVision.io SDK. Every application has its Product, so it is more clear and well-arranged that way. You can have one Product or ten Products, and it depends only on you.
